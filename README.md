# pig-game
Javascript learning project developed as part of a Udemy course. This is a simple game coded in vanilla Javascript as a learning exercise. 

Pig Game is a push-your-luck dice rolling game for 2 players. Players take turns rolling six-sided dice one-by-one. On a 1, play passes to the other player automatically. Any other result adds to a tally of points. At any time during their turn, a player may bank this tally into their point total and pass play to the other player. The first player to bank a total of 100 points wins!
